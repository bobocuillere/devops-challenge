FOR SCREENSHOT 1:

The high and consistent 2xx status codes means that the application is generally serving successful requests, 
but sometimes they are spikes in 4xx errors suggesting occasional client-side issues, possibly due to invalid inputs or authorization problems. 
there are  peaks in 5xx errors around 8 PM, I think some server-side issues.

-------------------

In the different time metrics, Treatment Time and Queue Time change a lot, with Queue Time having spikes throughout the day. 
This could mean that requests are occasionally piling up, which could be because of high traffic or limited resources. 
Response and Connection Times also show some increases, which might means network or server latency issues during peak times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR SCREENSHOT 2:

I see high activity especially for consumers kfconspg-pgdb08 and kfconspg-pgdb09, with  peaks that can mean either backlogs or a new peak of processing activity.

There is noticeable difference in metrics on the different Kafka partitions, which could means  an uneven load distribution among partitions. 
This might need a better load balancing or some changes in Kafka.
