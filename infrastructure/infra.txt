The issue with the original playbook was that it attempted to install the emacs package using the apt module without sufficient privileges. 
To resolve the issue, I added become: yes in the playbook to ensure that the task runs with root privileges. This allows the apt module to install the emacs package successfully.

You can try by running the following command:
`docker run --rm -it <IMAGE NAME> ansible-playbook playbook.yml`

I added the --rm tag to delete the container after the run.
